        <p>The persistence of symptoms in Lyme disease patients following antibiotic therapy, and their causes, continue to be a matter of intense controversy. The studies presented here explore antibiotic efficacy using nonhuman primates. Rhesus macaques were infected with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and a portion received aggressive antibiotic therapy 4–6 months later. Multiple methods were utilized for detection of residual organisms, including the feeding of lab-reared ticks on monkeys (xenodiagnosis), culture, immunofluorescence and PCR. Antibody responses to the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-specific C6 diagnostic peptide were measured longitudinally and declined in all treated animals. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> antigen, DNA and RNA were detected in the tissues of treated animals. Finally, small numbers of intact spirochetes were recovered by xenodiagnosis from treated monkeys. These results demonstrate that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> can withstand antibiotic treatment, administered post-dissemination, in a primate host. Though <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> is not known to possess resistance mechanisms and is susceptible to the standard antibiotics (doxycycline, ceftriaxone) <italic>in vitro</italic>, it appears to become tolerant post-dissemination in the primate host. This finding raises important questions about the pathogenicity of antibiotic-tolerant persisters and whether or not they can contribute to symptoms post-treatment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Lyme borreliosis is caused by the spirochetes of the <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> sensu lato species complex. The clinical progression of Lyme borreliosis may be divided into early-localized, early-disseminated, and late stages. During the early-localized phase, the disease's most prevalent sign is an erythematous skin rash known as erythema migrans. Subsequently, patients may develop early-disseminated disease with dermatologic, rheumatologic, cardiac, and neurologic involvement. Patients with late disease present chiefly with arthritis or with neurologic manifestations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Steere1">[1]</xref>. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has issued guidelines for Lyme borreliosis therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-WormserGary1">[2]</xref>. Signs and symptoms are usually successfully ameliorated with antimicrobial therapy. However, some patients continue to have persistent subjective complaints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Asch1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Shadick1">[4]</xref> while a few patients fail to respond to antibiotic therapy, as made evident by signs of persistent infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-WormserGary1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Steere2">[5]</xref>. The response to treatment in patients with late manifestations is typically slower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-WormserGary1">[2]</xref> and sometimes remains incomplete.</p>
      <p>Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) is a condition that occurs in some patients after treatment for Lyme borreliosis. The cause of PTLDS is currently unknown but prolonged antibiotic therapy does not seem to be helpful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Klempner1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Klempner2">[7]</xref>. Objective evaluation of this phenomenon in humans is complicated by the difficulty in obtaining a patient population with confirmed Lyme borreliosis treated post-dissemination, and the vague, non-specific symptoms (fatigue, headache, memory and concentration difficulties, myalgias and arthralgias) with which PTLDS patients present. In addition, reliable procedures to determine that infection has been cleared from Lyme disease patients have not been established.</p>
      <p>The C6 ELISA detects antibodies to a region of the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> VlsE lipoprotein that is immunogenic in infected individuals and common to all infectious variants tested thus far. Not only is the C6 test among the most reliable in terms of accuracy, but it is also a serologic test for Lyme disease that has been used experimentally as a predictor of treatment outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Philipp1">[8]</xref>. In patients with PTLDS, anti-C6 titers were found to generally persist at a low level compared to acute patient titers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Fleming1">[9]</xref>. To date, the experimental assessment, in animals, of antibiotic treatment effectiveness, measured by the presence or absence of spirochetes, correlated with C6 serologic test reactivity has not been reported.</p>
      <p>Signs and symptoms of putative failure of antibiotic treatment in late disease or ineffectiveness of repeated treatment in patients with PTLDS may be formally attributed to several causes, including: 1) spirochetes that persist in the tissues, likely in small numbers, inaccessible or impervious to antibiotic; 2) inflammatory responses to residual antigens from dead organisms; or 3) autoimmune responses, possibly elicited by antigenic mimicry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Bolz1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In an effort to gain insight into the viability of these hypotheses, we designed two experiments in which we respectively assessed the efficacy of two regimens of ceftriaxone and/or doxycycline treatment in rhesus macaques commencing at 4–7 months of infection with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. Rhesus macaques were chosen because of the ability of this animal model to reproduce many of the key signs of human Lyme disease, including neuroborreliosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Philipp2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Roberts1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Roberts2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Philipp3">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-England1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Pachner1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Cadavid1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Cadavid2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Pachner2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Pachner3">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Bai1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Cadavid3">[22]</xref> and because of the similarity between the available pharmacokinetics data for ceftriaxone and doxycycline in rhesus macaques and in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-DelRio1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Patel1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Matsui1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Maesen1">[26]</xref>. Our results confirm that spirochetes are capable of persisting in treated nonhuman primate hosts. We discuss the possible mechanisms and need for further inquiry into this phenomenon.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We performed two separate experiments to assess post-treatment persistence by <italic>B. burgdorferi in</italic> nonhuman primates with treatment administered at different phases of disseminated infection. Both experiments involved infection, treatment post-dissemination, serology and detection of spirochetes in tissues. The two varied in the number of animals, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> strain used, time interval prior to treatment, antibiotic treatment regimen, and detection methods. The first (Experiment 1) was aimed at evaluating animals treated at the late disseminated phase of infection and the treatment regimen was chosen to correspond to the regimen used to treat human PTLDS patients in a clinical evaluation of treatment for this population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Klempner1">[6]</xref>. The outline for Experiment 1 is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029914-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

          <title>Evidence of spirochetal infection</title>
          <p>During the first 4 weeks post-inoculation (PI), skin biopsies were taken weekly to assess infection by culture. All of the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-inoculated animals yielded culture-positive skin biopsies. In addition, antibody in serum samples that were obtained just prior to the initiation of antibiotic treatment yielded both a positive <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> whole-cell antigen ELISA, and a positive C6 ELISA in all of the inoculated animals (not shown).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2a2">
          <title>Evidence that doxycycline had reached the MIC in serum of treated animals</title>
          <p>Serum specimens were obtained from 7 rhesus macaques that were treated with doxycycline as per the regimen of Experiment 1, and 50 µL of each specimen was tested, as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section, for relative concentration. The mean doxycycline concentration at the peak time (2 h) was 2.071±0.431 mg/L or 6.7-fold the MIC of 0.31 mg/L. The median concentration was 2.2 mg/L (range 1.5–2.7). In another experiment, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was used as the indicator strain. Serum specimens were obtained from 5 additional doxycycline-treated animals both at peak and trough times. The mean doxycycline concentration at the peak was 0.630±0.125 mg/L (median 0.60 mg/L, range 0.45–0.75) and at the trough (12 h) it was 0.160±0.082 mg/L (median 0.15, range 0.10–0.30). The overall median value of the peak doxycycline concentration was 1.35 mg/L and ranged from 0.63–2.07 mg/L). Thus, at the peak, the mean concentration of antibiotic exceeded the MIC in these animals by a factor of 2, but not at the trough, when it was 0.52-fold the MIC. The serum concentration of ceftriaxone was not determined. However, the published concentration of ceftriaxone in rhesus plasma after a single intravenous dose of 20 mg/Kg varies from over 200 mg/L at time zero, to about 50 mg/L at 6 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Matsui1">[25]</xref>. The published MIC and MBC for ceftriaxone with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> sensu stricto (B31) are 0.013 mg/L and 0.050 mg/L, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-BaradaranDilmaghani1">[27]</xref>. Therefore, it is likely that the concentration of ceftriaxone in the rhesus circulation remained above the MIC and the MBC for a significant portion, if not all of the 24-h interval between consecutive doses of this antibiotic.</p>

          <title>Distinct patterns in the antibody response to C6</title>
          <p>The antibody response to C6 was measured in serially collected serum specimens. In all of the infected animals, the C6 antibody index rose steeply within the first 5–8 weeks post-inoculation (PI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029914-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thereafter, the responses fit into three patterns, depending on whether the animals were or were not treated with antibiotics. In the treated group, the response declined steadily during the treatment period and reached background levels at the endpoint in all animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029914-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029914-t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the responses of the untreated group remained either largely unchanged (5 out of 12 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029914-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, scored positive (+) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029914-t001">Table 1</xref>), or returned to background levels (7 out of 12 animals, scored negative (−) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029914-t001">Table 1</xref>) but not in parallel with the kinetics of the treated group's decline in specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029914-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The vertical lines in the figures denote the treatment intervals with ceftriaxone and doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029914-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), or sham (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029914-g002">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). A comparison of the number of animals with a negative C6 response postmortem in the treated group (11/11) with those in the untreated group (7/12) yielded a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0373).</p>

              <title>Patterns of antibody response to the C6 peptide in infected animals.</title>
              <p>The C6 index measured as a function of time PI with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> followed three distinct patterns in Experiment 1. Each graph is the longitudinal antibody response to C6 from one representative animal for each pattern. In treated (n = 12) animals (A) the response declined sharply, almost to background levels, within the antibiotic administration periods (solid vertical lines, weeks 27–31 for ceftriaxone, weeks 31–39 for doxycycline). In sham-treated animals (B, C) the response either declined, but independently from the sham treatment intervals, to eventually reach background level (B, n = 7), or oscillated throughout the study period without ever declining steadily (C, n = 5). The pattern in (C) corresponds to the C6-positive animals, indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029914-t001">Table 1</xref>. The dotted lines in B and C indicate the sham-treatment intervals. The index cut-off value was calculated as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref>.</p>

          <title>Monitoring of infection status postmortem</title>
          <p>Infection status postmortem was evaluated by culture, PCR, RT-PCR, gross pathology, histology, and immunofluorescence. All of the animals were assessed, except one of the animals in the treated group (AK21), which died due to anesthetic shock 3 months PI. With regard to culture of spirochetes, one of the treated animals yielded a positive culture and only one of the untreated animals was culture-positive (lung tissue).</p>
          <p>With regard to PCR, tissues were assessed for spirochetal DNA by PCR that amplified both the <italic>flaB</italic> and <italic>ospA</italic> genes of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. Among the untreated group, 2 animals were positive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029914-t001">Table 1</xref>). Here, spirochetal DNA was found in the dorsal root ganglia for one animal, and in the heart for the other. One of the animals of the treated group was PCR positive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029914-t001">Table 1</xref>), and in several organs, including the meninges, bladder, spleen, and lungs. The difference between treated and untreated groups was not statistically significant (p = 1.000).</p>
          <p>For detection of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> transcript, RNA was extracted from heart and brain specimens. Two of the animals that were not treated with antibiotics were positive, one in heart and the other in brain. Two of the treated animals had detectable spirochetal RNA in the heart, and one additional treated animal was positive for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> RNA in both heart and brain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029914-t001">Table 1</xref>). The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.6464).</p>
          <p>In the assessment of gross pathology, histology, and immunofluorescence, no gross lesions were observed in any of the animals. Fragments of heart and meninges were collected postmortem, and fixed, sectioned and stained for histology and immunofluorescence. Three animals, all of them treated, had moderate to severe inflammatory lesions in the heart (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029914-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029914-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

          <p>At 7 and 11 months PI, all monkeys were fed upon by <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> nymphs for the uptake of persisting spirochetes by xenodiagnosis. The number of nymphs that fed to repletion varied considerably between animals.

Tick midguts were split into 3 parts for culture, direct fluorescence and for DNA extraction. The probability of recovering spirochetes would be higher from animals upon which more ticks feed. As such, intact spirochetes were detected from the cultured midgut contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029914-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) or directly from tick midgut smears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029914-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) of two animals at 7 months PI, both of which had been treated.

          <p>A few spirochetes grew in cultures of organ tissues collected post-mortem from each animal after &gt;9 weeks, but we were unable to subculture any spirochetes from either treated or untreated animals due to their slow growth.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In some cases, patients who have been treated for Lyme disease experience persistent symptoms. The assertion that further antibiotic treatment is warranted in these cases is a matter of contention and considerable debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Auwaerter1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Stricker1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Feder1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Mayer1">[36]</xref>. Our results indicate that disseminated spirochetes of two different <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> strains can persist in the primate host following high dose, or long-lasting antibiotic therapy. In terms of disease, only objective signs of disease post-therapy may be measurable in an animal model. While we did not find gross signs of disease postmortem, in Experiment 1 we did identify heart sections with inflammatory infiltrates in three of the treated animals. In addition, several animals, both treated and untreated showed sections of heart and meninges that were positive by immunofluorescence for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. At the molecular level, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> DNA would indicate the presence of organisms, live or dead. The detection of RNA, however, should indicate that those present are metabolically active and thus alive. In Experiment 1, spirochetal DNA and RNA were detected in the tissues of a few animals, independent of treatment. This may reflect a low spirochetal burden, lack of <italic>flaB</italic> transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Barthold1">[37]</xref>, and/or seclusion in untested tissues.</p>
      <p>In Experiment 2, we were able to recover spirochetes by xenodiagnosis in two of the three treated animals. The inability to recover spirochetes from all five macaques could be in part attributed to the number of ticks that fed, which was markedly smaller for untreated animals (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029914.s002">Table S2</xref>). However, a few slow-growing organisms were recovered by culture from each animal. We detected the <italic>ospA</italic> transcript in culture pellets from tissues of four animals and directly from at least one tissue from each animal. We chose <italic>ospA</italic> because this gene has been shown to be transcribed by host-adapted <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Crowley1">[38]</xref>, in disseminated infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Narasimhan1">[39]</xref>, and because of the induction of an anti-OspA response in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Kalish1">[40]</xref> post-dissemination.</p>
      <p>The nature of the persistent organisms and the acquisition of tolerance to antibiotics are questions that need to be addressed. The <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> spirochete is known to invade collagenous tissue as a possible mechanism of immune evasion. It has been postulated that the joint tissues provide a protective niche during antibiotic treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-YrjNInen1">[41]</xref>. Our studies and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Barthold1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Hodzic1">[42]</xref>, however, have not demonstrated a specific predilection for spirochete presence in joints of treated animals. Antibiotic tolerance has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> with several bacterial species, both gram negative (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and gram positive (<italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp.). The fact that organisms can persist in the presence of antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporins (ceftriaxone) that interfere with cell wall synthesis appears to stem from their ability to enter a dormant, non-dividing state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Lewis1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Lewis2">[44]</xref>, thus avoiding the need for cell wall synthesis to continue growth. The other antibiotic that was used in these experiments is doxycycline. The tetracycline class of antibiotics corrupts translation at the ribosome; therefore, minimal gene expression from dormant organisms may be unaffected. A “persister” phenotype may possibly be responsible for the recalcitrance of persisting spirochetes made evident by previous studies in mice and dogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Barthold1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Hodzic1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Straubinger1">[45]</xref>, and by those presented in this report. Perhaps incomplete clearance of bacteria following antibiotic treatment is not a phenomenon unique to <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, but one that occurs with other bacterial infections as well. In this case, xenodiagnosis enables detection of otherwise inconspicuous live organisms through acquisition by the natural vector.</p>
      <p>To date, the C6 ELISA is the only test in which a decline in antibody titer is statistically associated with outcome of antibiotic treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Philipp1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Philipp4">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Philipp5">[47]</xref>. In accord with this finding, we observed a distinct and rapid decline in C6 titer in all antibiotic-treated animals. Not all animals, however, were spirochete-free, so the question of what facet of infection is indicated by anti-C6 antibody titers was brought to the fore. Also, the C6 titers declined in some untreated animals over a long period of time, but not in others, though presence of spirochetes was indicated in C6-negative untreated animals by IFA or PCR/RT-PCR. This is likely due in part to genetic differences in outbred animals. Possible explanations for the lack of correlation between C6 response and presence of spirochetes include: (1) the anti-C6 titer is an indicator of treatment efficacy and the infection is cleared despite the presence of spirochetal genetic material/antigen; (2) organisms persist and the anti-C6 titer does not reflect their presence, perhaps due to loss of plasmid lp28-1 (which encodes VlsE, the parent molecule of C6); or (3) anti-C6 titer declines with a significant reduction in spirochetal burden, but a low number of organisms reside in the host; if these organisms are dormant, then transcription of <italic>vlsE</italic> also may be negligible, minimizing re-stimulation with antigen. The detection of intact organisms ruled out the first explanation and detection of transcript (<italic>bbf26</italic>) from lp28-1 disproves that explanation #2 may be operating exclusively. We therefore favor explanation #3 and seek to determine the level of transcriptional/metabolic activity, and pathogenicity of persistent organisms. If, for example, spirochetes that are recovered by xenodiagnosis from treated animals turned out to be non-pathogenic, this would validate the decline in C6 titer as a measure of successful treatment outcome.</p>
      <p>In infected mice treated with tigecycline, transcription of the chromosomally-encoded <italic>B. burgdorferi oppA2</italic> gene was detected in 8 of 9 treated mice, indicating spirochetal viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Barthold1">[37]</xref>. Importantly, these studies also indicated that DNA copies of another gene, <italic>ospA</italic>, were present in treated mice, but were significantly fewer than in untreated mice. This result likely reflects a much lower spirochetal burden with treatment, supporting the notion that anti-C6 titer may decline as a function of reduced numbers. The C6 titers in these mice were not determined. Due to the relatively small quantities of bacteria over a large amount of tissue, we were unable to reliably quantify DNA or transcript levels in nonhuman primates. Similarly, the recovery of few spirochetes by tissue culture is aptly a reflection of the rhesus model and not necessarily the treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Pachner4">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The most pressing question in terms of human disease is whether or not spirochetes remain pathogenic after antimicrobial therapy. Similarly, do spirochetes persist long-term, or are they eventually cleared by the host? Clearly, the phenotype of persistent organisms needs to be elucidated. These studies support the use of the C6 test for diagnosis and measurement post-treatment; however, the absolute quantification of antibody levels may be essential in determining treatment efficacy for PTLDS patients, as low levels (yet above baseline) may indicate presence of residual spirochetes or antigen. Finally, the use of variable and pulse-dosing regimens of antibiotics may improve efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Lewis1">[43]</xref> and this warrants testing in an appropriate model.</p>
      <p>Finally, in these studies we used an artificial mode of inoculation and spirochetal dose. The experimental results must be confirmed with tick-mediated infection, which is our intent. Our studies do however offer proof of the principle that intact spirochetes can persist in an incidental host comparable to humans, following antibiotic therapy. Additionally, our experiments uncover residual antigen associated with inflammatory foci. Whether persistent spirochetes or spirochetal antigen can cause PTLDS remains unanswered.</p>

        <title>Determination of the serum concentration of doxycyline <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
        <p>In vitro-cultured <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> do not grow well in the presence of monkey serum, so antibiotic concentrations in serum had to be tested with alternative reporter strains of bacteria. A 0.5 McFarland suspension of bacteria (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, ATCC #29213 or <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, ATCC #6633), made in Mueller-Hinton broth (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), was streaked onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates (BD). The streaking was done so that a confluent “lawn” of bacteria would grow after 18–24 hours of incubation at 37°C. To determine antibiotic concentration in serum, 50 µL of serum from treated animals was applied to 6-mm diameter plain paper discs (BD) and allowed to dry for 30 minutes. Standards were made by dissolving doxycycline hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich) into normal monkey serum; these were applied to the discs in the same manner. Standard doxycycline concentrations were 2, 5 and 10-fold the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) when <italic>S. aureus</italic> was used, and 0.5, 1, and 2-fold the MIC when <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was used. Both indicator strains were used in order to expand the range of detection. The doxycycline MIC for the JD1 strain of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> was determined to be 0.310 mg/L, which was approximately the same as the mean value of 0.327 mg/L that had previously been obtained for several strains and species of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> sensu lato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-BaradaranDilmaghani1">[27]</xref>.</p>

Serum from treated animals was obtained both at the times of peak and trough concentrations for doxycycline, namely, at 2 h and 12 h post-dose administration, during the 8<sup>th</sup> week of doxycycline treatment.

At 28 weeks PI, 10 laboratory-reared nymphal <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> ticks were placed on the back of each animal through a containment capsule by a procedure that has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Philipp2">[11]</xref>. Briefly, the area of the back to be used for tick placement was shaved and wiped with SkinPrep (Smith &amp; Nephew Medical, UK). The tick containment capsule was fixed to the skin at its base with Super Glue and at the edges with SkinBond contact adhesive (Smith &amp; Nephew Medical). The capsule was further secured into place with Hypafix tape (Smith &amp; Nephew Medical). The ticks were placed inside the capsule on the skin and sealed over with a piece of nylon mesh and screw cap lid, so that ticks could not escape from the capsule. The average feeding time for ticks is 72 hours, so to allow time for them to feed to repletion, they were removed 4 days later. For tick removal, the capsules were opened and ticks were collected with a paintbrush. Ticks that had not detached from the skin were removed carefully with forceps. The capsules were gently removed by dissolving the adhesive with UniSolve (Smith &amp; Nephew Medical) so as not to irritate the skin.</p>
        <p>Ticks were washed with 1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% benzalkonium chloride and 70% ethanol for 1 min each and crushed in 45 µL PBS with a microfuge pestle. The contents were split into three 15-µL portions for: (1) direct fluorescence assay (DFA); (2) culture; and (3) PCR. For DFA, the samples were smeared on microscope slides, dried and fixed with acetone. The samples were stained with an anti-<italic>Borrelia</italic>-FITC antibody (KPL) and examined by fluorescence microscopy to detect the presence of spirochetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0029914-Jacobs1">[59]</xref>. For culture, samples were added to ∼4 mL BSK-H medium and incubated for 8 weeks at 34°C, in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and influx of N<sub>2</sub> to produce a microaerophilic environment.</p>
