      <abstract>
        <p>The pre-fibrillar stages of amyloid formation have been implicated in cellular toxicity, but have proved to be challenging to study directly in experiments and simulations. Rational strategies to suppress the formation of toxic amyloid oligomers require a better understanding of the mechanisms by which they are generated. We report Dynamical Monte Carlo simulations that allow us to study the early stages of amyloid formation. We use a generic, coarse-grained model of an amyloidogenic peptide that has two internal states: the first one representing the soluble random coil structure and the second one the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-sheet conformation. We find that this system exhibits a propensity towards fibrillar self-assembly following the formation of a critical nucleus. Our calculations establish connections between the early nucleation events and the kinetic information available in the later stages of the aggregation process that are commonly probed in experiments. We analyze the kinetic behaviour in our simulations within the framework of the theory of classical nucleated polymerisation, and are able to connect the structural events at the early stages in amyloid growth with the resulting macroscopic observables such as the effective nucleus size. Furthermore, the free-energy landscapes that emerge from these simulations allow us to identify pertinent properties of the monomeric state that could be targeted to suppress oligomer formation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>A number of normally soluble proteins can form amyloid structures in a process associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Mature amyloid structures consist of large fibrils containing thousands of individual proteins aggregated into linear nanostructures; there is increasing evidence, however, that the toxic species responsible for neurodegeneration are not the mature fibrils themselves but rather lower molecular weight precursors commonly known as amyloid oligomers. Unfortunately, these early oligomers are commonly thermodynamically unstable and of nanometer scale dimensions, factors which make them highly challenging to probe in detail in experiments. We have used computer simulations of a model inspired by Alzheimer's Abeta peptide to investigate the early stages of protein aggregation. The results that we obtain were shown to fit Oosawa's polymerization theory, a finding which allows us to provide a connection between the microscopic molecular parameters and macroscopic growth. One crucial parameter is size of the nucleus, i.e. the basic oligomer existing at origin of the formation of each fiber. We have revealed a path for the formation of this nucleus and validate its size by several methods. Our results provide fundamental information for influencing the early stages of amyloid formation in a rational manner.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A wide range of normally soluble proteins and peptides are known to have a propensity to aggregate into <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-sheet rich amyloid fibrils. Such structures do sometimes posses functional roles, for instance as functional coatings and catalytic scaffolds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Kelly1">[1]</xref>. However, more often than not, the formation of amyloid structures is a pathogenic event – it is the hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Selkoe1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Dobson1">[3]</xref>. A diversity of experimental <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Danielsson1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Kardos1">[9]</xref>, and theoretical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Davis1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Knowles2">[15]</xref> approaches have been developed to probe the mechanisms of amyloid formation. Such studies have shed light on the structural and kinetic aspects of amyloid growth; it has, however, proved to be very challenging to characterise the very early stages of this reaction, in particular the primary nucleation events and the subsequent formation of low relative molecular weight oligomers. Yet there is substantial evidence that these small oligomers, rather than mature fibrils act as neurotoxins, and are implicated in the pathological cascades that underlie neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Haass1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Walsh1">[18]</xref>. Hence, despite the technical challenges associated with the study of this phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Orte1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Knowles3">[20]</xref>, a quantitative understanding of the kinetics of oligomer formation is of great practical and fundamental importance in the context of neurodegeneration and more generally in relation to aberrant protein self-assembly.</p>
      <p>The growth of linear aggregates following a nucleation event is described in its simplest form by the classical theory of nucleated polymerisation, developed by Oosawa originally to study the formation of cytoskeletal filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Oosawa1">[21]</xref>. Within this framework, the time dependence of the mass fraction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the fibrils can be expressed as follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Oosawa1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Cohen1">[22]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002692.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the nucleus size, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an effective rate constant which contains contributions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from both the nucleation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the elongation rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the filaments, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the initial mass concentration of the monomers, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the mass concentration of the fibrils and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the mass fraction of the fibrils. The key parameters in Oosawa's theory are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, since <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is known a priori. This formalism has been extended by Ferrone, Eaton and coworkers in their pioneering studies of the aggregation of sickle haemoglobin to include secondary nucleation events such as filament fragmentation and surface catalysed nucleation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Ferrone1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Ferrone2">[24]</xref>; in the present paper we focus on homogeneous nucleation which is crucial in the formation of the primary nuclei.</p>
      <p>Several groups have reported numerical simulations of the nucleation and growth of amyloid fibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Gaspari1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Li1">[35]</xref>. Such simulations provide invaluable microscopic insight into the mechanism of amyloid formation. The focus of the present paper is different: we wish to compute quantities that are directly accessible to experiment, such as the time dependence of fibril formation, and apply to these quantities the same analysis that is applied to experimental data. This approach allows us to test whether a reliable estimate of the critical nucleus size can be obtained by fitting the experimental fibril-growth curve to an analytical approximation, and sheds light on the microscopic and mechanistic interpretation of the nucleus size. In addition, our simulations allow us to follow in detail the pathway by which amyloid fibril nucleation takes place and shed light on the condensation-reorganisation mechanism that underlies the primary nucleation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Serio1">[36]</xref>. Since primary nucleation processes are very rare events, and the critical nucleus is by definition the species after the highest free energy barrier and therefore lowest relative concentration within the aggregation pathway, simulations are currently the most fruitful avenue to access the structural determinants of the critical nucleus and to follow its formation and the subsequent conversion to amyloid fibrils.</p>
      <p>In the present paper we study fibril nucleation by considering a highly simplified model of amyloidogenic peptides that captures the salient features of this self-assembly process. A key property of amyloidogenic peptides is that they change conformation when converting from their normal soluble form into the amyloid state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Dobson1">[3]</xref>. Our model has two internal states: one (denoted the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-state) has weak intra-peptide interactions and represents the soluble random coil structure, the other (the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-state) has a significantly higher intrinsic internal energy, but has stronger interpeptide attractions. The higher internal energy of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-state results from the loss of conformational degrees of freedom relative to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-state, and its higher propensity to form inter-peptide contacts is a consequence of the availability of the residues for hydrogen bonding with neighboring peptides in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sheet conformation. In this picture, fibril nucleation takes place once the free-energy gain due to aggregation compensates the free energy cost of converting the monomers to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-state. The model that we use is based on a peptide model reported in ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Vacha1">[37]</xref>. that has been extended to account for the two-state nature of amyloidogenic peptides (see section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">methods</xref>). Because this model is simple and therefore computationally highly tractable, it allows us to study the behavior of large numbers of peptides. Specifically, we can use it to compute the fibrillar growth profile and the free-energy landscape for oligomer formation. We used dynamic Monte Carlo simulations to generate trajectories for an ensemble of peptides in a system with periodic boundary conditions. In what follows, we relate the properties of the present model system to solutions of A<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> peptides with a length of 40–42 amino acid residues, which are the major components of the aberrant deposits found in connection with Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Selkoe1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Dobson1">[3]</xref>. With this mapping, the conditions of our simulations correspond to a concentration range of 0.2–8 mM. For more details on the model and the simulation method, see section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">methods</xref>.</p>

    <sec id="s2" sec-type="methods">
      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>We used Dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Kikuchi1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Sanz1">[41]</xref> for our simulations. In this method, the displacements, that can occur are so small, that no unphysical moves can occur. Moreover, the parameters of individual moves (translation and rotation) are fitted to experimental timescales such as diffusion and rotational constants. The values were taken from one of the most studied amyloid forming peptides A<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and were averaged between its 40 and 42 amino acid long forms (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at 300 K) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Bora1">[42]</xref>. Hence, maximum displacement was d<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nm and maximum rotation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and consequently the time of our simulation step <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (when on average all particles move, i.e., sweep) can be roughly related to 0.02 ns.</p>
      <p>The amyloidogenic peptides were modeled as Patchy Spherocylinders (PSC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Vacha1">[37]</xref>, i.e. cylinders with hemispherical caps at both ends and with an attractive stripe on its side. As was shown in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Vacha1">[37]</xref> such particles can either occur in an oligomeric form or assemble into amyloid-like structures with two filaments, depending on the model parameters. Unlike the model described in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Vacha1">[37]</xref>, the present model peptides can occur in two possible states: the first one (denoted as the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-state) corresponds to the random coil conformation of peptide in solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Tycko1">[43]</xref>; the second state (called <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-state) corresponds to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-sheet structure found in the fibrils. The free energy difference corresponding to change from the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-state, is denoted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The attractive stripe is responsible for self-assembly and the cross-section of small oligomers in ideal conformation are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002692-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Chirality was introduced into the model in order to reproduce the relatively long persistence length of the amyloid fibrils.

        <p>A representative snapshot of the late stage of a simulation of fibril growth is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002692-g002">Figure 2</xref>: it reveals that aggregation results in fibrillar species with a morphology similar to that observed in experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Knowles4">[48]</xref>. Our simulations allow us to follow the time dependence of the aggregation number and hence of the mass of individual aggregates as they grow. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002692-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows a representative time trace. Initially the system is in a purely monomeric state. As a result of the collision of two peptides, a dimer can be formed. The dimer can either dissociate into monomers, or can grow to a trimer through monomer addition. The oligomers with an aggregation number below four are highly dynamic and interconvert readily between different aggregation states, including dissociation to monomer. However, tetramers, once formed, always develop into a fiber, which suggests that the size of the critical nucleus is 4 or just below. In what follows, every oligomer containing four or more monomers is counted as a fiber. At later times, as larger aggregates emerge, the numbers of monomers and oligomers (dimers and trimers) decreases through the incorporation of peptides into larger structures.</p>

        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002692-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows the average increase in the aggregate mass concentration obtained at a fixed concentration (0.51 mM). We first tested whether these data could be fitted to the Oosawa theory. We find that, as is the case for experimental studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Knowles2">[15]</xref>, analysis of the system under a single set of conditions does not yield strong enough constraints to allow a reliable estimate of the parameters in Oosawa's theory to be obtained. Indeed, fits of similar quality were obtained with critical nucleus sizes varying between 2.0 and 5.0. This finding therefore highlights the difficulty in resolving microscopic parameters, in this case the critical nucleus size, from macroscopic bulk data at a single concentration since a similar shape of the curve can be obtained for different combinations of the nucleus size and the nucleation rate. These two parameters can be disentangled, however, when data at different concentrations are considered. The average growth profiles of the simulation with different initial monomer concentrations were simultaneously fitted to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002692.e004">Eq. 1</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002692-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

        <p>To test the sensitivity of Oosawa's theory in identifying processes other than nucleation and growth, we also employed a model characterized by the absence of chirality compared to the model used previously (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). In such a system, the persistence length of the polymers is low for bending mode parallel to the narrow dimension of the rectangular cross-section. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002692-g006">Figure 6A</xref> we show that there is a systematic deviation from the fit according to Oosawa's theory. In particular, the growth is always faster at the beginning and slower at the end of the growth than the fit. The reason is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002692-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, where we can see that a flexible fiber can bent into a ring like structure, thereby effectively removing a potential growing site from the system (i.e., the fibrillar end is not accessible for further monomer addition). The fusion of fibrils, which we observed for both the non-chiral and the chiral models, also leads to a decrease in the late-stage rate of growth of fibrils. Neither ring formation nor fusion are accounted for in Oosawa's theory, and this fact could explain the slight deviation of the simulation data from the fit shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002692-g006">Figure 6</xref>. Note that at lower concentrations not all the monomers are depleted from the bulk at the end of simulation. This is also the case in the chiral model and reflects the finite probability for monomers to dissociate from the aggregates leading to an equilibrium between the monomeric and aggregated forms of the peptides as is observed in experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Baldwin1">[50]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Free energy landscape of oligomers</title>
        <p>The simulations allow us to follow the time evolution of single aggregates as they form. This information makes it possible to relate the macroscopic average quantities such as the scaling exponents characterising the lag-time, to microscopic events taking place on the level of individual peptides. Based on classical nucleation theory, the free energy profile along the reaction coordinate (aggregation number) increases from the monomer up to a maximum, after which it monotonically decreases under supersaturated conditions. The point of the maximum free energy is related to the size of the critical nucleus. We define the nucleus as the first oligomer after this free energy barrier, in other words the nucleus is the smallest oligomer, which has a higher probability to grow than to shrink.</p>
        <p>In order to look at the nucleation from yet another perspective, we constructed a free energy landscape for the different kinds of oligomers up to tetramer using the following procedure: The free energy of a mixed oligomer <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be decomposed into several parts:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002692.e074"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e074" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>The enthalpic contribution, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to the free energy of an oligomers (<italic>i</italic>-mer, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was determined as the minimum of the interaction energy of a given oligomer, which is schematically depicted with the enthalpic values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002692-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Naturally, the bigger the oligomer and the larger the patch, the stronger the interaction is. Importantly, due to the patch size, a tetramer of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-particles (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) has no enthalpy gain compared to its trimer counterpart (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>
        <p>The next contribution is the free energy associated with changes in the internal degrees of freedom of the protein molecule, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; this value is large compared to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> since the experimental measurements only report evidence for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> state in solution: no free molecules in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> state are observed. The free energy difference is fixed at 15 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each monomer which changes its state from the soluble <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> state to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> state that it assumes in the aggregates (for more details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>The last contribution is entropic <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the temperature and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the entropy; this contribution stems mainly from the loss of translational entropy upon binding to the cluster, but it also includes the rotational and internal entropy.</p>
        <p>Two additional simulations were carried out, each with fixed type of achiral monomers (pure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and pure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The free energy of the <italic>i</italic>-mers was determined based on their relative populations (see supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002692.s001">Text S1</xref>). The enthalpic contributions can be determined directly by computing the relevant interaction terms in an ideal configuration. By subtracting it from the free energy and by dividing by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> we obtain the entropy per monomer for each (pure) <italic>i</italic>-mer. Assuming that the entropy of a single particle in a given state is similar in all (mixed) <italic>i</italic>-mers independent of their composition, we can construct the free energy landscape of the oligomers <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; again using the enthalpic contribution for an ideal configuration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002692-g007">Figure 7</xref> and the supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002692.s001">Text S1</xref> for a detailed description of how to construct it). Note, that the achiral monomers were employed for this calculation as it easier to determine the ideal maximum interaction enthalpy and therefore enthalpic contribution to the free energy. The nucleation for achiral and chiral model is very similar as they differ mainly in the later stage as self-assembled fibrils in their rigidity.</p>

        <p>The analysis of the energy landscape reveals the microscopic details through which primary nucleation occurs in the coarse grained system. The path of the lowest energy connecting the monomeric states with the aggregates starts with the assembly of a dimer <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of molecules in an unstructured state. At this stage, the free energy cost for the conversion of one of the molecules in the dimer to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> state is 9.2 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, less than the cost of the conversion in solution, 15 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but still sufficiently high for this mechanism not to be the major contribution to the overall production of aggregates. However, the unstructured trimer <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, obtained through monomer addition from the dimer <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, possesses a lower free energy than the mixed dimer <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and at this stage the conversion of one of the molecules to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> state is associated with a significantly lower cost of 3.2 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> resulting in the species <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Subsequent conversions to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> state are associated with an even smaller energy cost, and the species <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is only 0.3 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> higher in free energy relative to the species <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This mixed aggregate represents the species with the highest free energy on the aggregation pathway; subsequent additions of monomers to this nucleus lower its free energy and result in the formation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-sheet fibrils. Therefore the nucleus size in the formulation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002692.e004">Eq. 1</xref> is 4, in excellent agreement with the analysis performed on the average kinetic data. The first fully <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-sheet aggregate is the tetramer <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>The overall nucleation pathway that emerges from our simulations is that of a nucleation process followed by a conformational conversion. The conversion step is, however, dependent on the addition of monomers and does not take the form of one step cooperative conversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Serio1">[36]</xref>. In particular the critical nucleus is a mixed, partially converted, aggregate rather than the fully unconverted species. This finding is likely to be of general value since the mechanism identified in the present study allows the conversion of a number of monomers in discrete steps combined with monomer addition steps to avoid the high free energy barrier associated with a conversion of the entire aggregate in a single step. These results therefore generalise the nucleated conformational conversion model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Serio1">[36]</xref> to include multi-step conversion.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have devised a simulation scheme which allows us to study a system of aggregating peptides and compute quantities that are directly accessible in experiments, such as the scaling behaviour of the lag-time with aggregate concentration, and to relate these characteristics to the microscopic events that underlie the generation of single nuclei and their subsequent growth. In order to reach the long time scales required for such a study, we have employed a coarse-grained model, which includes a representation of the internal degrees of freedom of the polypeptide chain as well as the possibility to assemble into both oligomers and elongated fibrils. The obtained sigmoidal growth of the oligomers is in agreement with previous studies employing different two state models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Gaspari1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Pellarin1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The nucleus size was found to be in mutual agreement from all the employed methods. The most trivial one is the empirical observation of the oligomers' time distribution, where our results show that all tetramers develop into a fibril. The second method is the fit of the growth profile to Oosawa's theory, which has to be performed with data at varying initial monomer concentration for unambiguous results. The fitted nucleus size is 3.8. The same result was obtained from our analysis of the free energy landscape for the oligomer formation. The coarse grained system that we study possess parameters that are representative of experimental systems, where nucleus sizes of the order of 2–4 are commonly reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Hellstrand1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Knowles2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Ruschak1">[51]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We found very good agreement of our simulated fibril growth with the theory of Oosawa, especially for the chiral model. The small deviations can be due to the fact that our simulation time is rather small (somewhere around 2 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>s, compared to hours in many experiments), a factor which required high concentrations in order to observe fibril growth. Some processes such as fibril fusion could, therefore, be enhanced under the conditions used in the simulations. Note that the current implementation of our model does not lead to any secondary nucleation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Cohen1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Ferrone1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Ruschak1">[51]</xref> and the scale of our simulations prevents the fibril breakage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Knowles2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Collins1">[52]</xref>. As a result we have not observed secondary nucleation pathways which would lead to different kinetics of fibril formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Knowles2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002692-Cohen1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The ability to compute the free energy landscape of the oligomers allowed us to study the sequence of events that leads to the generation of a fully <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-sheet aggregate from the monomeric <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002692.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> precursor state. We found that the that this conversion occurs concomitantly with the growth of the oligomers through monomer addition. Furthermore, the critical nucleus is found to be a mixed species including both converted and unconverted peptides, and its size is in good agreement with that determined from the analysis of the scaling behaviour of the average lag-time. This concerted mechanism allows the energy penalty from the conversion of individual peptides to be compensated by the energy gain from an increase in the number of favorable inter-peptide contacts.</p>
