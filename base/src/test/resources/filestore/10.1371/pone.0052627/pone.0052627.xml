      <abstract>
        <p>Caveolae are specialized domains of the plasma membrane, which play key roles in signaling, endocytosis and mechanosensing. Using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy (TIRF-M), we observe that the exocyst subunit Exo70 forms punctuate structures at the plasma membrane and partially localizes with caveolin-1, the main component of caveolae. Upon cell detachment, we found that Exo70 accumulates with caveolin-1-positive vesicular structures. Upon cell re-adhesion, caveolin-1 traffics back to the plasma membrane in a multistep process involving microtubules and actin cytoskeleton. In addition, silencing of Exo70 redirects caveolin-1 to focal adhesions identified by markers such as α5 integrin or vinculin. Based on these findings, we conclude that Exo70 is involved in caveolin-1 recycling to the plasma membrane during re-adhesion of the cells to the substratum.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Caveolae are bulb-shaped pits present in several mammalian cell types including adipocytes and muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Parton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Parton2">[2]</xref>. These structures play key roles in compartmentalization and organization of signaling pathways for cell growth and differentiation. In addition, caveolae were recently implicated in membrane-mediated mechanical responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Sinha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Goetz1">[4]</xref>. Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is the main component of caveolae. Cav1 adopts a hairpin-like shape within the membrane bilayer with both the N and C-terminus facing the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Parton1">[1]</xref>. Recent studies showed that the Cav1 partner protein, Polymerase I and Transcript Release Factor (PTRF)/cavin-1 selectively associates with mature caveolae at the plasma membrane and is involved in caveolae formation and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Parton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-McMahon1">[5]</xref>. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF-M) allowed characterizing the dynamics of individual caveolae and revealed that caveolae can be stored in stationary multi-caveolar structures at the plasma membrane, or undergo kiss and run processes without disassembling the caveolar coat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Pelkmans1">[6]</xref>. Moreover, caveolae can undergo long-range cytoplasmic transport during diverse regulated processes such as mitosis and during loss of integrin-based adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Parton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Boucrot1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-delPozo1">[8]</xref>. All together, these data suggest some interplay between caveolar trafficking and cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Echarri1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Initially identified in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the exocyst complex comprises eight subunits named Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70 and Exo84 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-He1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Munson1">[11]</xref>. This complex controls the docking and insertion of secretory and endocytic recycling vesicles to growing regions of the plasma membrane and impinges on diverse cellular processes requiring polarization of membrane trafficking such as cell motility and neuronal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Hertzog1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Muriel1">[13]</xref>. In yeast, Exo70 interacts with phospholipids at the plasma membrane and is crucial for tethering of secretory vesicles for exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-He2">[14]</xref>. Phospholipid binding and plasma membrane localization are conserved in mammalian cells suggesting a similar role of Exo70 in targeting of the exocyst complex to the plasma membrane and regulation of vesicle docking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-He2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Liu1">[16]</xref>. Previous studies showed that detachment of cells from integrin-mediated adhesion triggers the caveolin-dependent internalization of lipid rafts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Echarri1">[9]</xref>. Conversely, re-adhesion of cells to the ECM induces the re-insertion of lipid rafts to the plasma membrane in a process that involves the Ras-related GTP binding proteins RalA and ARF6 and their downstream effectors, exocyst complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Spiczka1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Balasubramanian1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Balasubramanian2">[19]</xref>. However, the specific contribution of Exo70 to Cav1 trafficking remains largely unknown.</p>
      <p>Here, using TIRF-M we could show that Exo70 accumulates in punctuate plasma membrane domains where it co-localized with Cav1. Upon cell detachment, Exo70 localized to Cav1-positive intracellular compartments. When cells were allowed to re-adhere, silencing of Exo70 led to the accumulation of Cav1-positive structures at the cell periphery close to focal adhesions (FAs), suggesting that loss of Exo70 function results in Cav1 mistargeting during cell spreading.</p>

        <title>Exo70 co-localizes with Cav1 at the plasma membrane</title>
        <p>TIRF-M revealed a punctuate distribution of Exo70-mCherry on the adherent surface of Hela cells and co-localization with a subset of Cav1-GFP-positive structures (representing 20 to 30% of total Cav1-positive structures) and probably corresponding to caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052627.s001">S1A</xref>). Live-cell confocal spinning disk microscopy confirmed this punctuate pattern and plasma membrane localization of Exo70-GFP whereas Cav1-mRFP associated predominantly with intracellular vesicular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). It has been previously reported that Exo70 binds directly to phospholipids and that binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2 mediates interaction of Exo70 with the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-He2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Liu1">[16]</xref>. When we used the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding protein tubby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Santagata1">[20]</xref>, tubby-GFP was present in plasma membrane punctuate structures observed by TIRF-M, which partially localized with Exo70-mCherry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052627.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>) indicating that Exo70 localization sites at the plasma membrane are enriched in PtdIns(4,5)P2.</p>

        <p>Caveolae internalization can be triggered by several stimuli, including loss of integrin- mediated cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-delPozo2">[21]</xref>. Upon cell detachment, Cav1-positive PM domains initiate an inward traffic to the perinuclear area. Hela cells expressing Cav1-mRFP and Exo70-GFP were detached from the substratum by trypsinization, maintained for 1 hr in suspension, replated onto fibronectin (FN)-coated substrate and visualized by spinning disk microscopy. Cav1-mRFP was observed in dynamic vesicles that shuttled between the perinuclear region and the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> and movie S1). Analysis of the distribution and dynamics of Exo70-GFP during cell replating revealed that Exo70 was strongly associated with Cav1-positive vesicles throughout the cell (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g002">2A</xref>). Thus, these results reveal a dynamic association of Exo70 with Cav1 transport intermediates following cell detachment and re-adhesion. In addition to Cav1, cavin-family proteins are required for caveolae formation and PTRF/cavin-1 associates with mature caveolae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Hill1">[22]</xref>. Interestingly, cavin-1 partially redistributed with Cav1 in intracellular vesicles in cells replated on FN-coated substrates after detachment, suggesting that mature caveolae are internalized and trafficked upon cell detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In addition, we acquired time-lapse sequences of HeLa cells expressing either Cav1-GFP and Exo70-mCherry or Cav1-mRFP and Exo70-GFP by TIRF-M (data not shown). These movies were acquired starting 1, 2, or 3 hours after cell detachment and replating. In all cases, we observed that 100% of Exo70-positive structures were Cav1-positive, while only a subset (20–30%) of Cav1-positive structures co-localized with Exo70 (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are involved in distinct steps of Cav1 trafficking</title>
        <p>To identify mechanisms underlying cell detachment-induced Cav1 redistribution, we investigated the involvement of cytoskeleton components using nocodazole and cytochalasin-B (cytoB), which destabilize microtubule and actin networks, respectively. Treatment with nocodazole induced a blockade of Cav1 transport, which accumulated in a network of static tubulo-vesicular extensions extending towards the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, movie S2), indicating that recycling of Cav1 to the surface is a MT-dependent process. Inhibition of actin assembly by treatment with cytoB induced the redistribution of Cav1 to small, scattered vesicles in the central region of the cells and in some peripheral accumulations at the cell edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, movie S3). Remarkably, a network of radially extending tubular membranes connected the perinuclear vesicles and the peripheral Cav1 pools. Collectively, and in agreement with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Wickstrom1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Wickstrom2">[24]</xref>, these observations suggest that both MTs and actin cytoskeleton are involved in distinct steps of Cav1 trafficking: (i) a MT-dependent long range transport from perinuclear endosomal compartments that we identified as late endosomes (LEs) by co-localization with GFP-rab7 and GFP-VAMP7 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052627.s002">Figure S2</xref>) (ii) and an actin-dependent step involved in Cav1 trafficking at the cell periphery.</p>

        <title>Silencing of Exo70 leads to an accumulation of Cav1 in focal adhesions</title>
        <p>Cav1 is internalized together with integrins upon cell detachment and β1 integrin regulates Cav1 trafficking and recycling to the plasma membrane for caveolae reassembly upon cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Wickstrom3">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Wickstrom4">[26]</xref>. Consistent with these findings, we observed a partial co-localization of α5-integrin-GFP with Cav1-mRFP in cytoplasmic vesicles upon cell detachment and re-adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). In addition, α5-integrin-GFP associated with reforming focal adhesions at the cell edge, which were negative for Cav1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g004">Fig. 4A and A′</xref>). Noticeably, in 20% of the cells, Cav1-mRFP and α5-integrin-GFP associated with membrane tubules extending radially from the perinuclear compartments, and frequently targeting newly reformed focal adhesions (movies S3 and S4). All together, these findings indicate that Cav1 and integrins traffic together in tubulo-vesicular transport carriers to the cell periphery.</p>

        <p>We investigated whether Exo70 may play a role in Cav1 trafficking and recycling upon cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Thapa1">[27]</xref>. Silencing of Exo70 using two independent siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052627.s003">Fig. S3</xref>) inhibited cell spreading on fibronectin-coated substratum during the early phase of replating (3 to 6 hrs after replating) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052627.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), Silencing of Exo70 caused the accumulation of Cav1-mRFP to peripheral α5-integrin-positive structures with a morphology typical of focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, compare panels A and B and linescan profiles in panel A′ and B′). Co-localization of Cav1 and α5-integrin was quantified and compared between mock- and siExo70-treated cells in a peripheral region of the cells enriched in focal adhesions (see Material and Methods section) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In mock-treated cells, we observed a 26.6% co-localization of Cav1-mRFP and α5-integrin-GFP in the peripheral region. This percentage increased to 42–45% in cells depleted for Exo70 with two-independent siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). These results suggest that, in the absence of Exo70, Cav1 (or Cav1-positive vesicles) is retained in focal adhesions. Next, we addressed the effect of Exo70 knockdown on the distribution of endogenous Cav1 protein. Hela cells were detached and maintained in suspension for 60 min before replating on fibronectin for 3h, and labeled for endogenous Cav1 and the focal adhesion protein vinculin. Using the quantification method described above, we found a 6.3% co-localization of Cav1 and vinculin at focal adhesions. This value increased to 10–12% in cells depleted for Exo70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that depletion of Exo70 results in an accumulation of Cav1 at focal adhesions.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study reveals that Exo70 accumulates in dotty structures, which are visible by TIRF-M at the plasma membrane. Exo70-positive plasma membrane domains are enriched in PtdIns(4,5)P2, a lipid known to mediate binding of Exo70 at the plasma membrane both in yeast and mammal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-He2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Liu1">[16]</xref>. In addition, in mammalian cells Exo70 has been shown to recruit other exocyst components to the plasma membrane and to control the tethering of secretory vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Zuo1">[15]</xref>. Thus, Exo70-positive puncta that we observed at the adherent plasma membrane of HeLa cells may represent some exocytic vesicles docking sites. Interestingly, these puncta also appear to be enriched for the main caveolar component, Cav1.</p>
      <p>Whether caveolae can mediate endocytosis of specific cargo(es) is still a matter of debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Parton1">[1]</xref>. In contrast, several studies have documented the internalization of caveolae in internal compartments during diverse cellular processes including mitosis and cell detachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Boucrot1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-DelPozo1">[28]</xref>. Cell adhesion signaling through ß1 integrins seems to play a key role for the recycling of caveolar components and the formation of caveolae at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Pelkmans1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Santagata1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Wickstrom1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Wickstrom2">[24]</xref>. Keratinocytes from mice knockout for ß1 integrin or integrin-linked kinase (ILK) show a very low level of caveolae due to impaired traffic of Cav1-containing transport vesicles along microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Wickstrom1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Wickstrom2">[24]</xref>. ILK was shown to promote the recruitment of actin regulators allowing stable insertion of caveolae into the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Wickstrom2">[24]</xref>. Our study confirms that intracellular transport of Cav1 is a multistep process controlled by cell adhesion. First, cell detachment leads to a massive redistribution of Cav1 and α5ß1 integrins in a perinuclear compartment. This compartment is rab7- and Vamp7-positive suggesting that upon cell detachment, Cav1 is internalized and trafficked to late endosome/lysosomal compartments. This is reminiscent of the effect of cholesterol depletion or serum deprivation, which trigger caveolae accumulation into late endosomes/lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Mundy1">[29]</xref>. Members of the cavin protein family, which comprise four proteins including cavin-1/PTRF are also crucial for caveolae formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-McMahon1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Hill1">[22]</xref>. Here, we observed that Cav1 partially redistributed with cavin-1 after cell detachment, suggesting that mature caveolae are internalized and traffic upon cell detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052627-g002">figure 2B</xref>). A recent study supports the conclusion that under normal conditions, upon docking and fusion of Cav1-positive transport carriers with the plasma membrane at nascent focal adhesions, Cav1 would be segregated away from focal adhesion to redistribute laterally along the plasma membrane bilayer for caveolae assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Muriel2">[30]</xref>. Our data indicate that in adherent cells, at steady-state, Exo70 domains co-localize with a subset of Cav1-positive structures at the plasma membrane, very likely corresponding to caveolae, while these proteins show no association in the cytoplasm. Upon cell detachment and readhesion, Cav1 redistributes to late endosomes and strongly co-localizes with Exo70. Upon silencing of Exo70, Cav1 (or Cav1-positive transport carriers) are retained at focal adhesions and mistargeted, suggesting that Exo70 is involved in Cav1 recycling to the plasma membrane during readhesion of the cells to the substratum.</p>
      <p>To conclude, functions for caveolae have been identified in biomechanical remodeling or mechanosensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Sinha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-Goetz1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052627-DelPozo1">[28]</xref>. Indeed, Cav1 and caveolae are abundant in cells experiencing high mechanical stress such as muscle, skin and endothelial cells. The fact that Cav1 and caveolae levels at the cell surface are regulated by cell adhesion provide a rational for the regulation of caveolae assembly by mechanical clues.</p>
